Atlas project
===================

This project template was generated with "foundations init". In this project you'll find the following structure:


- Configuration
---------------

job.config.yaml

A configuration file that defines characteristics of how your job will run

- Main
-------
main.py

A sample main that shows how to use basic Atlas functionality

- Data
-------

/data

This is where you can put your data if its a reasonable size to be transmitted over your network from your machine to the environment where the worker will run.
A preferred solution would be to have your data available on your compute infrastructure and mount it into your worker
